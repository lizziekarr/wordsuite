          <h3>Hello, I'm Susan Schott Karr,</h3>
          <h2>WRITER</h2>

          <p>With an eye toward business development, my work is done behind the scenes and all has to do with making written communications more effective.</p>
          <!--p Recently, I served as interim communications director and then senior communications writer at UC Hastings College of Law in San Francisco, and as a writing coach at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.-->

        <div class="copy-title dev-copy">Development editing</div>
        <div class="picture-copy dev-copy">Taking a look at the big picture, I can help you structure or restructure your writing, ensuring that it unfolds in a logical, interesting, and informative way, includes all of the information that it should, and leaves out anything extraneous or irrelevant. At this stage, we're taking a broad sweep, perhaps developing an outline and considering which features and aspects of the work are required.</div>
        <div class="copy-title line-copy">Line editing</div>
        <div class="picture-copy line-copy">Sentence by sentence, I will read through your writing to ensure that it has the correct tone for your audience and flows smoothly. Your text may require light editing or a heavier, more substantive treatment. I'll look at your word selection, sentence and paragraph structure, use of parallelism and active voice. As I work, I'll mark up your text and comment about the changes I've made and the logic behind them.</div>
        <div class="copy-title copy-copy">Copyediting</div>
        <div class="picture-copy copy-copy">Although some copyediting may begin at the line editing stage, it is here that I'll take an even closer look at the text. I'll take into account accuracy, formatting, and style. Specifically, I'll look at spelling, grammar, punctuation, jargon, terminology, and semantics. The end result? Copy that is clear, correct, concise, comprehensible, and consistent.</div>
        <div class="copy-title proof-copy">Proofreading</div>
        <div class="picture-copy proof-copy">At this final stage in the editing process, the main point is to have "another set of eyes" to review your work. When you are too familiar with what you've written, it's difficult to see the word in the sentence that you've repeated, the inconsistent spacing between sentences, or the random spelling error. This stage represents the chance to "fix" any remaining errors and a final fine-tuning of your prose before it's ready to send off or publish.</div>
        <div class="copy-title coach-copy">Writing Coaching</div>
        <div class="picture-copy coach-copy">If you need a rigorous evaluation of how to make your writing even better, I can mark up your text with suggestions and provide a report analyzing its strengths and weaknesses. I'll include numerous examples and model ways in which you can improve your style, tone, language selection, and reading interest. Instead of having you sit by passively while I wield my editing pen, I'll give you some concrete new strategies and techniques to use in your future writing.</div>
